# BellyButton_HerokuApp
The purpose of this excercise is not to build a beatiful website, but to demonstrate an end to end dynamic visualization solution using SQLAlchemy database, plotty to build some graphs,
flask as the framework and Heroku to deploy it. <br>
<br>

The data set contains inforamtion about bellybutton biodiversity, it investigates the microbes inhabiting  them and the factors that might influence the life in it.
<br>
<br>


Our dataset contains 60 different samples (from 60 different people) and displays the top bacteria found in each sample, a scatterplot of the total microbs per bacteria class as well as basic data regarding the sample donor.
